## Build Now (This Week)

### 1. Fix Scan2Plan CPQ/proposal UI: streamline 'open deal' → 'generate quote' flow

### 2. Triage SuperChase approval gates: enumerate manual OAuth steps, implement bypass SOP

### 4. Deliver Purist pilot sell-sheet & StudioC 2-day shoot template

### 5. Create canonical 'daily action list' for owners/clients

## Friction to Resolve

| Area | Symptom | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| Scan2Plan - UI / Proposal Builder | Frustration with proposal builder UI; assembly, PandaDoc integration, and interface gaps | Blocks sales/publishing workflow; slows quoting and onboarding. |
| SuperChase / Automation approvals | Repeated manual approval steps and environment mismatches (clasp login, cloud vs local). | Agent autonomy reduced, increases manual intervention time. |
| Connector / Chat integrations | Connector not responding / deployment ID / webhook errors | Prevents automation, messaging and remote trigger workflows. |
| Media storage & asset management | Phone/computer full; no clear ingest/archive SOP | Blocks capture/transfer, delays turnaround, creates risk of lost assets. |
| Context/Thread management | Confusion from multiple threads & missing concise action lists | Wastes time, reduces execution velocity. |
| Product dev vs sales time allocation | Need to do revenue-generating work while product needs focus | Resource/time tension slows product finish and sales momentum. |
