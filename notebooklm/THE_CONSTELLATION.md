# The Chase Constellation
## A Unified System, Not Six Separate Businesses

## THE INSIGHT

These aren't six companies. They're one organism with six expressions.

                      🎚️ Utopia
                      (Creation)
```

**The pattern:**
- Utopia = where things are created (music, recordings)
- Studio C = how creation is captured and produced
- Big Muddy = where experiences happen (live music, hospitality)
- Scan2Plan = how spaces are documented
- Tuthill = how spaces are transformed
- CPTV = how all of it gets amplified

## REAL OPERATIONAL CONTEXT

### Tuthill Design (from Limitless)

**What it actually is:**
- Real estate / architectural photography + advanced visualization
- Photos, video, Matterport/scan, virtual staging, floor plans, renderings
- You + Elijah (runs shoots and operations)
- Chase Pierson Photography = separate brand for music/editorial (needs file separation)

**Actual services delivered:**
- Real estate photography, multi-camera video
- BTS, interviews, drone, Matterport scans
- Virtual staging (in-house), floor plans, renderings
- Fast-turn edits, on-site rough cuts
- Full-stack: scan → render → virtual stage → marketing assets

**Pain points identified:**
- File organization needs work (CPP vs Tuthill folders)
- Task/context handoffs failing between human + AI agents
- Marketing needs polish (emails, quotes, deliverability)
- Need Project Bible, naming conventions, SOPs

**Existing assets:**
- Strong creative/technical reputation in Hudson Valley
- Studio/video resources via Studio C
- Full-stack capability already proven
- Multi-tenant marketing platform in development

---

### Studio C (from Limitless)

**What it actually is:**
- Creative video/film production arm at Utopia Studios (Bearsville)
- Full-service multimedia production department
- Fractional production partner for studios, artists, filmmakers, brands
- Leverages Utopia infrastructure (API console, tie-lines to Bearsville Theater)

**Actual capabilities:**
- Live music/concert videos, music videos
- Multi-camera performance shoots (up to 10 cameras)
- Soundstage productions, podcast recording, tour rehearsals
- XR/AR / previsualization workflows
- Distributed/remote production tooling
- Shot designer app, wireless lighting control, Blackmagic Cloud

**Proof of concept:**
- 22-minute live scene build (talent show demo)
- Demonstrates rapid-build playbook approach

**Pain points identified:**
- Need to productize offerings
- Need clear web copy, image assets, brand docs for studioc.tech
- Hardware/ops: multiple logins, V-mount battery inventory, tripod plates
- Need team onboarding, shared presets, Project Bible

**Existing assets:**
- Historic location (Utopia/Bearsville legacy)
- World-class consoles and acoustics
- Vertical integration: recording → filming → post → broadcast
- Premium positioning ($5K-$50K ARPU clients)

## THE CONSTELLATION PRINCIPLE

Every client touchpoint should reveal the whole system:

**If someone hires Tuthill for photos:**
→ Mention Scan2Plan for complex spaces
→ Mention CPTV for the story

**If someone books Big Muddy:**
→ Mention Studio C for recording
→ Mention the blues heritage content

**If someone records at Utopia:**
→ Mention Studio C for video
→ Mention Tuthill for promo photos

**If someone needs scans:**
→ Mention Tuthill for visualization
→ Mention the full documentation pipeline

---

## VELOCITY FORMULA

**Current state:** 6 ventures operating somewhat independently
**Target state:** 1 constellation with 6 access points

**The math:**
- Each venture generates leads
- Each lead has potential for 2-3 ventures
- Cross-sell increases average deal size 40-60%
- Shared infrastructure reduces marginal cost

**Revenue multiplication:**
- Tuthill photo shoot: $1,200
- Tuthill + Scan2Plan: $4,500
- Tuthill + Scan2Plan + staging: $8,500

Same client, 7x revenue.

## QUESTIONS FOR THIS NOTEBOOK

1. "A client needs X - which ventures should we involve?"
2. "What's the full-stack offering for [client type]?"
3. "How do we turn this single-venture lead into a constellation client?"
4. "What operational improvements benefit multiple ventures?"
5. "Where are we duplicating effort across ventures?"

---

*The constellation doesn't compete with itself. It compounds.*
