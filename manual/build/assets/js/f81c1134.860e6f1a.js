Now I spend 3 minutes reviewing what 4 AI agents wrote. The quality? Better than before.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nContent marketing is critical. Everyone knows this. But when you\'re running multiple businesses, it\'s always the first thing to get deprioritized.\\n\\nWhy? Because writing a decent blog post takes 2-4 hours of focused time. Social posts need consistent voice. Publishing requires manual deployment to multiple systems.\\n\\nThe result: Marketing gets pushed to \\"someday\\" while revenue-generating work takes priority.\\n\\n## The Solution: A Synthetic Marketing Agency\\n\\nI built a 4-agent content factory that turns business activity into publishable content:\\n\\n| Agent | Role | Output |\\n|-------|------|--------|\\n| **Strategist** | Analyzes my activity, picks topics | Content brief |\\n| **Copywriter** | Drafts blog + social posts | Markdown drafts |\\n| **Editor** | Brand voice check, quality assurance | Approved content |\\n| **Publisher** | Deploys to Docusaurus + X.com | Published URLs |\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\n1. I do actual work on my businesses\\n2. The system logs significant wins to a manifest\\n3. When I want content, Strategist reads the manifest and picks a topic\\n4. Copywriter drafts based on my brand voice guide\\n5. Editor reviews for quality\\n6. Publisher posts to X.com and my blog\\n7. I review and approve in ~3 minutes\\n\\n## The Stack\\n\\n- **Manifest Protocol**: JSONL file tracking all business activity\\n- **Claude Code**: Orchestrates the 4 agents\\n- **SuperChase API**: Handles X.com posting via OAuth 1.0a\\n- **Docusaurus**: Static blog generation\\n\\n## What I Learned\\n\\nThe insight isn\'t \\"AI can write.\\" Everyone knows that.\\n\\nThe insight is: **AI agents with context write better than AI without context.**\\n\\nWhen the Strategist knows what I actually did this week, the Copywriter has real material to work with. The Editor knows my voice because it has my brand guide. The Publisher knows where to post.\\n\\nContext is everything.\\n\\n## What\'s Next\\n\\nWe\'re testing this across 4 businesses right now:\\n- Scan2Plan (reality capture)\\n- Studio C (production)\\n- Chase Pierson TV (personal brand)\\n- Tuthill Design (design methodology)\\n\\nIf the engagement holds and the quality stays high, I\'m packaging this for other founders at $499/mo.\\n\\n**Want early access?** DM me \\"AGENCY\\" on X.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*This post was generated by the Synthetic Marketing Agency and reviewed by a human in 3 minutes.*"},{"id":"/2026/01/20/introducing-superchase","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2026/01/20/introducing-superchase","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-20-introducing-superchase.md","title":"Introducing SuperChase - The AI Executive OS","description":"Building a business is hard.
