title: I Stopped Writing Blog Posts. Now AI Agents Do It For Me.

I used to spend 3 hours on each blog post. Now I spend 3 minutes reviewing what 4 AI agents wrote. The quality? Better than before.

## The Problem

Content marketing is critical. Everyone knows this. But when you're running multiple businesses, it's always the first thing to get deprioritized.

Why? Because writing a decent blog post takes 2-4 hours of focused time. Social posts need consistent voice. Publishing requires manual deployment to multiple systems.

The result: Marketing gets pushed to "someday" while revenue-generating work takes priority.

## The Solution: A Synthetic Marketing Agency

I built a 4-agent content factory that turns business activity into publishable content:

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Strategist** | Analyzes my activity, picks topics | Content brief |
| **Copywriter** | Drafts blog + social posts | Markdown drafts |
| **Editor** | Brand voice check, quality assurance | Approved content |
| **Publisher** | Deploys to Docusaurus + X.com | Published URLs |

## How It Works

1. I do actual work on my businesses
2. The system logs significant wins to a manifest
3. When I want content, Strategist reads the manifest and picks a topic
4. Copywriter drafts based on my brand voice guide
5. Editor reviews for quality
6. Publisher posts to X.com and my blog
7. I review and approve in ~3 minutes

## The Stack

- **Manifest Protocol**: JSONL file tracking all business activity
- **Claude Code**: Orchestrates the 4 agents
- **SuperChase API**: Handles X.com posting via OAuth 1.0a
- **Docusaurus**: Static blog generation

## What I Learned

The insight isn't "AI can write." Everyone knows that.

The insight is: **AI agents with context write better than AI without context.**

When the Strategist knows what I actually did this week, the Copywriter has real material to work with. The Editor knows my voice because it has my brand guide. The Publisher knows where to post.

Context is everything.

## What's Next

We're testing this across 4 businesses right now:
- Scan2Plan (reality capture)
- Studio C (production)
- Chase Pierson TV (personal brand)
- Tuthill Design (design methodology)

If the engagement holds and the quality stays high, I'm packaging this for other founders at $499/mo.
