# Cold Outreach Campaign: Architect Renovation Sequence

## Campaign Overview

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Target Audience** | Architects at firms with active renovation/adaptive reuse projects |
| **Sequence Length** | 3 emails |
| **Spacing** | Email 1 → Day 0, Email 2 → Day 4, Email 3 → Day 8 |
| **Primary Value Prop** | Prevent change orders through engineering-grade accuracy |
| **CTA** | 15-minute project consultation call |

---

## Targeting Criteria

### Ideal Prospect Profile
- **Role:** Principal, Project Architect, Project Manager at architecture firm
- **Firm Size:** 5-50 employees (large enough for renovation projects, small enough to not have in-house scanning)
- **Project Types:** Historic preservation, adaptive reuse, renovation, tenant improvement
- **Geography:** Northeast US (NY, NJ, CT, MA, PA) — within service area

### Trigger Events (Signals to Prioritize)
- Firm announced a renovation project in local press/AIA publications
- Permit filings for renovation/alteration work
- LinkedIn posts mentioning "existing conditions" or "as-built"
- Job postings for renovation-focused roles

### Exclusion Criteria
- New construction-only firms
- Firms with in-house scanning capability
- Residential-only practices

## Email 1: The Problem Frame
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "The $40K question on [Project Name/Building Type] renovations"
- B: "Quick question about your existing conditions process"

**Send:** Day 0

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Firm Name] is working on [specific project / "renovation projects in the [City] area"].

Quick question: How are you handling existing conditions documentation?

I ask because I keep hearing the same story from architects on renovation work:

> "We thought we had good measurements. Then demolition started."

The average unforeseen condition costs $12K-35K to resolve. Most renovation projects hit 2-4 of them. That's $25K-140K in risk hiding behind hand measurements and old drawings.

We help architecture firms eliminate that risk with engineering-grade reality capture—±3mm accuracy across the entire model, not the ±1-2% you get from visual scanning tools.

Would it be useful to see how this works on a project like yours? I can walk you through a recent case where we caught $68K in issues before design development.

15 minutes—happy to work around your schedule.

Best,

P.S. — Not selling scan services here. Just want to show you what engineering-grade documentation looks like so you can make an informed call on your next project.

## Email 2: The Proof Point
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "The beam nobody knew about"
- B: "How one scan prevented a $24K change order"

**Send:** Day 4 (if no reply)

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up with a quick story that might resonate.

Last month we scanned a historic bank in Kingston for an adaptive reuse project. 1895 building, no existing drawings, the usual situation.

During processing, we found a structural beam that didn't appear in any renovation records. It ran directly through the architect's proposed floor opening.

Their project architect told us: *"Without the scan data, we would have discovered that beam during demolition. That's a $24K change order minimum—probably more with the schedule delay."*

Total issues caught before design development: $68K.

**The difference:** Most scanning vendors quote manufacturer specs. We verify registered accuracy on every project—±3mm across the model, documented in a QA report you can share with your client.

Worth 15 minutes to see the actual deliverables?

## Email 3: The Breakup + Value Add
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "Closing the loop (+ renovation risk checklist)"
- B: "Last note + something useful"

**Send:** Day 8 (if no reply)

---

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short—I know you're busy.

I've reached out a couple times about reality capture for your renovation projects. If the timing isn't right or you've got existing conditions handled, no worries at all.

But before I close the loop, I wanted to share something useful regardless:

**[LINK: "5 Existing Conditions Risks That Kill Renovation Budgets" — PDF or blog post]**

It's a quick checklist we put together from patterns we've seen across 50+ renovation scans. Covers the issues that consistently show up and how to spot them early—whether you're using our services or not.

If a project comes up where engineering-grade documentation makes sense, I'm here.

Best,
[Sender Name]

P.S. — We work with firms across the Northeast on everything from historic preservation to tenant improvements. If you have colleagues who deal with existing conditions headaches, happy to be a resource for them too.
