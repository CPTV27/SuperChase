# GC Partnership Pitch Deck

## Scan2Plan — White-Label Scanning Partnership

*One-Page Partner Pitch for General Contractors*

---

# Partner With Scan2Plan
## Add Reality Capture to Your Services — Without the Investment

---

## The Opportunity

Your clients need accurate as-built documentation. But laser scanning requires:
- $50K-$150K in equipment
- Specialized training
- Processing software licenses
- Dedicated staff time

**What if you could offer scanning services without any of that?**

---

## How It Works

```
Your Client Needs Scan → You Quote the Work → We Execute → You Deliver & Bill
```

### Simple 4-Step Process:

1. **Client requests as-built documentation**
   You receive the RFQ like any other scope item

2. **You quote using our pricing guide**
   We provide transparent base rates — you add your markup

3. **We scan and process**
   Our team handles all field work and deliverables

4. **You deliver to your client**
   White-label files, your branding, your relationship

## Why Partner With Scan2Plan?

### 1. Engineering-Grade Precision
We're not a Matterport tour company. Our scans are built for construction — ±3mm accuracy that stands up to field verification.

### 2. AEC Industry Experience
We speak your language: RFIs, change orders, clash detection, LOD specs. We've worked on projects from 2,000 sqft renovations to 200,000 sqft facilities.

### 3. Reliable Scheduling
We show up when we say we will. Our field team is professional, insured, and knows how to work around active construction.

### 4. White-Label Ready
Your client never sees our name unless you want them to. All deliverables can be branded to your firm.
