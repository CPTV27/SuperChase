## The Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About

You've been here before.

The project starts. The drawings say one thing. The field says another. And suddenly you're writing an RFI, pushing back a deadline, and explaining to the client why the budget just moved.

**The culprit?** Inaccurate as-built information.

It's the silent budget killer on renovation projects—and most teams don't realize how much it's costing them until it's too late.

## By the Numbers: What Field Measurement Errors Actually Cost

Let's look at what the data tells us about dimensional discrepancies on renovation projects:

### Industry Statistics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average RFIs per renovation project | 25-35 | ENR/FMI Research |
| RFIs caused by existing condition errors | 15-25% | McGraw-Hill Construction |
| Average cost per RFI cycle | $1,500-$3,000 | ASCE Project Management |
| Average schedule impact per RFI | 2-5 days | Construction Management Association |
| Change orders tied to field conditions | 30-40% | Turner Construction Survey |

### Translation: Real Project Impact

On a typical **15,000 sqft renovation**:
- Expected RFIs from measurement errors: **4-8**
- Cost impact: **$6,000-$24,000**
- Schedule impact: **8-40 days**

On a typical **50,000 sqft renovation**:
- Expected RFIs from measurement errors: **8-15**
- Cost impact: **$12,000-$45,000**
- Schedule impact: **16-75 days**

**And that's before you count the soft costs:** design rework, overtime, client frustration, team morale, and the projects you don't win next time because your reputation took a hit.

## The Math: Manual Measurement vs. 3D Scanning

Let's break down a real comparison.

### Scenario: 20,000 sqft Office Renovation

#### Option A: Traditional Approach
- Field crew: 2 people × 8 hours × $75/hr = **$1,200**
- Return trips for missed dimensions (2×): **$800**
- Design rework from errors (conservative): **$3,000**
- RFI processing (3 RFIs × $2,000): **$6,000**
- Schedule delay cost (10 days × $500/day): **$5,000**

**Total Hidden Cost: $16,000**

#### Option B: Laser Scanning
- Scan-to-BIM deliverable: **$5,000-$7,000**
- Return trips: **$0** (comprehensive capture)
- Design rework from errors: **$0** (±3mm accuracy)
- RFIs from dimensional issues: **$0**
- Schedule delays: **$0**

**Total Cost: $5,000-$7,000**

#### Net Savings: $9,000-$11,000

**ROI: 130-180%**

## The Compounding Effect

Here's what most people miss: the cost of bad data compounds throughout the project.

```
Week 1: Wrong dimension discovered → RFI written
Week 2: RFI response received → Design modified
Week 3: Modified design sent to fabricator → Lead time restarts
Week 4: Original material arrives wrong → Restocking fee + reorder
Week 5: Correct material arrives → Installation crew rescheduled
Week 6: Installation complete → 5 weeks late
```

**One bad measurement → 5 weeks of cascade.**

Multiply that by the 3-5 dimensional surprises typical on a renovation, and you understand why projects blow budgets.

## When Scanning Pays for Itself

Laser scanning isn't right for every project. Here's when it delivers clear ROI:

### High ROI Scenarios

✅ **Renovation/adaptive reuse** — Existing conditions are the whole game
✅ **Historic preservation** — Accuracy requirements are non-negotiable
✅ **MEP-heavy projects** — Hidden systems create the most surprises
✅ **Tight tolerances** — Custom millwork, fit-outs, equipment installation
✅ **Multiple phases** — Same building, multiple interventions over time
✅ **BIM-required projects** — Model accuracy drives downstream value
✅ **Complex geometry** — Curved walls, irregular shapes, ornate details

### Break-Even Analysis

| Project Size | Scanning Cost | RFIs Avoided to Break Even |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 5,000 sqft | ~$2,500 | 1-2 |
| 15,000 sqft | ~$6,000 | 2-3 |
| 50,000 sqft | ~$15,000 | 5-8 |

**If you avoid just 2-3 RFIs on a typical renovation, scanning has paid for itself.**

## The Calculator: Run Your Own Numbers

### Quick Estimate Formula

```
Potential Savings = (Project sqft × 0.25) - Scanning Cost

Where:
- 0.25 = conservative $/sqft error cost on renovations
- Scanning Cost = approximately $0.30-0.50/sqft for Scan-to-BIM
```

### Example Calculations

| Project Size | Error Cost (est.) | Scan Cost | Net Savings |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 10,000 sqft | $2,500 | $3,500 | -$1,000 |
| 20,000 sqft | $5,000 | $6,000 | -$1,000 |
| 30,000 sqft | $7,500 | $8,000 | -$500 |
| 50,000 sqft | $12,500 | $12,000 | +$500 |
| 75,000 sqft | $18,750 | $16,000 | +$2,750 |
| 100,000 sqft | $25,000 | $20,000 | +$5,000 |

**Note:** These are conservative estimates using average error rates. Projects with complex existing conditions, MEP intensity, or tight tolerances will see significantly higher savings.

## What You Get With Scanning (That You Can't Get Otherwise)

### Beyond Dimensional Accuracy

1. **Complete Coverage**
   Every surface, every angle, every detail — captured in one visit. No "we didn't measure that" surprises.

2. **Permanent Record**
   Point cloud data is archived. Need a dimension 6 months later? Pull it from the data, not a return trip.

3. **Design Freedom**
   When you trust your as-builts, you can design to tighter tolerances. That means better design, not safer design.

4. **Clash Detection**
   Run your BIM model against the point cloud before construction. Find the conflicts in the computer, not the field.

5. **Client Confidence**
   Show them the data. Show them the model. Remove the "trust us" from the conversation.

## The Real Question

You're going to spend money on existing conditions documentation either way.

The question is: do you spend it proactively (scanning) or reactively (RFIs, rework, delays)?

**Proactive is always cheaper.**
