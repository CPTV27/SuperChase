# Case Study: Rondout Savings Bank Historic Renovation

## Engineering-Grade Documentation Prevents $68,000 in Change Orders

### Project Overview

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Building** | Rondout Savings Bank (1895) |
| **Location** | Kingston, NY |
| **Square Footage** | 12,400 SF across 3 floors |
| **Project Type** | Adaptive reuse: Bank to mixed-use commercial |
| **Client** | Hudson Valley Development Partners |
| **Architect** | Barton Partners Architecture |
| **Timeline** | Scan: 2 days | Deliverables: 10 business days |

---

### The Challenge

The Rondout Savings Bank presented documentation challenges typical of historic renovation projects:

- **No existing drawings** — Original 1895 construction documents lost to time
- **Multiple renovations** — At least three undocumented modifications over 130 years
- **Ornate architectural details** — Tin ceilings, decorative cornices, and custom millwork requiring precise capture
- **Structural unknowns** — Bearing walls, floor conditions, and MEP routing unclear behind plaster

The architecture firm initially considered traditional hand measurement, estimating 3-4 weeks of field time and acknowledging they'd still face measurement uncertainty during construction.

### The Solution: Engineering-Grade Reality Capture

Scan2Plan deployed a comprehensive scan-to-BIM workflow with our 12-Point Reliability Standard:

**Field Operations**
- 2-day site scan using Leica RTC360 terrestrial scanner
- 147 scan positions capturing 98.6% of accessible surfaces
- Control network established with ±1.5mm registration accuracy
- Supplemental detail scans for ornamental elements

**Deliverables**
- Full Revit model at LOD 300 (Architectural + Structural)
- 2D CAD floor plans, reflected ceiling plans, sections
- Point cloud dataset (E57 format) for contractor access
- Variance report documenting all as-found conditions

### Measurable Results

#### Time Savings

| Traditional Method | Scan2Plan Method | Savings |
|--------------------|------------------|---------|
| 15-20 field days | 2 field days | **85% reduction** |
| 6-8 week delivery | 10 business days | **75% faster** |
| 3 return trips (est.) | 0 return trips | **100% complete capture** |

#### Cost Impact

The engineering-grade accuracy (±3mm) delivered measurable financial outcomes:

**Change Orders Avoided**

| Issue Identified in Scan Data | Estimated Change Order Cost |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Undocumented structural beam at floor 2 opening | $24,000 |
| Existing MEP conflicts in ceiling plenum | $18,500 |
| Floor elevation variance (1.75" slope) | $15,000 |
| Masonry condition at window headers | $10,500 |
| **Total Change Orders Prevented** | **$68,000** |

**Project Economics**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Scan2Plan Investment | $15,600 |
| Change Orders Prevented | $68,000 |
| **Net ROI** | **336%** |

### Deliverable Gallery

**Before: No Documentation**
> The architect had nothing — no drawings, no reliable dimensions, no way to know what was behind those plaster walls. Every measurement was a guess.

**After: Complete Digital Twin**
- 47 million point cloud coordinates
- Full Revit model with 1,200+ elements
- Every architectural detail captured to ±3mm
- Clash detection run before design finalized

---

### Critical Finding: The Hidden Beam

During point cloud processing, our team identified a steel beam at the second floor that didn't appear in any previous renovation records. This beam ran perpendicular to the proposed new opening in the architect's design.

> "Without the scan data, we would have discovered that beam during demolition. That's a $24,000 change order at minimum — probably more with the schedule delay."
>
> — **Sarah Chen, Project Architect, Barton Partners**

The beam was visible in the point cloud data as a subtle 2-inch displacement in the floor framing above. Traditional measurement would have missed it entirely.

### Client Testimonial

> "We've worked with survey firms before, but Scan2Plan delivered something different — they gave us a building we could actually design in. The Revit model wasn't just documentation; it was a design tool. We found four major conflicts before we broke ground. On a historic renovation, that's the difference between a profitable project and a disaster."

### Why Engineering-Grade Matters

This project illustrates the gap between marketing-grade virtual tours and engineering-grade reality capture:

| Marketing-Grade (Matterport) | Engineering-Grade (Scan2Plan) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ±1-2% accuracy (industry standard) | ±3mm accuracy (measured & verified) |
| Visual documentation | Dimensional documentation |
| Useful for marketing, pre-lease tours | Useful for design, construction, FM |
| Cannot detect structural anomalies | Identifies hidden conditions |
| No clash detection capability | Full BIM integration |

For renovation projects where change orders determine profitability, engineering-grade accuracy isn't optional — it's the project's insurance policy.
