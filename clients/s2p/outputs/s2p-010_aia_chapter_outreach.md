## Talk Title Options

### Option 1: Technical Deep-Dive (Most Requested)

**Title:** "From Point Cloud to Construction Documents: A Practical Guide to Scan-to-BIM for Renovation Projects"

**Description:**
This technical session walks through the complete scan-to-BIM workflow for renovation and adaptive reuse projects. Attendees will learn how laser scanning captures existing conditions, how point cloud data is processed into usable models, and how to specify scanning services that actually deliver value. Includes live demo of point cloud navigation and real project case studies.

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Format:** Presentation + live software demo + Q&A
**CE Credits:** 1.0 AIA LU (HSW if applicable)

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Understand the difference between survey-grade scanning and visual documentation tools
2. Identify project types where scanning delivers ROI vs. traditional methods
3. Learn how to specify scan-to-BIM deliverables in project contracts
4. Navigate point cloud data and extract dimensions

---

### Option 2: ROI-Focused (Decision-Makers)

**Title:** "The Business Case for Reality Capture: Reducing RFIs, Change Orders, and Rework on Renovation Projects"

**Description:**
Field measurement errors on renovation projects cost the industry billions annually in rework, delays, and change orders. This session presents data on the true cost of dimensional discrepancies and makes the business case for investing in accurate as-built documentation upfront. Includes ROI calculator and real project cost comparisons.

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes
**Format:** Presentation + case studies + ROI worksheet
**CE Credits:** 1.0 AIA LU

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Quantify the cost of field measurement errors on typical projects
2. Compare ROI of scanning vs. traditional documentation methods
3. Structure contracts to include appropriate as-built documentation scope
4. Evaluate scanning proposals and avoid common specification mistakes

---

### Option 3: Historic Preservation Focus (Specialized)

**Title:** "Documenting History: Laser Scanning for Historic Preservation and HABS/HAER Compliance"

**Description:**
Historic preservation projects demand documentation accuracy that traditional methods struggle to achieve. This session explores how laser scanning meets Secretary of Interior standards, produces HABS/HAER-compliant measured drawings, and captures irreplaceable architectural details. Includes examples from landmark projects and discussion of archival best practices.

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Format:** Presentation + case studies + preservation discussion
**CE Credits:** 1.0 AIA LU (HSW)

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Understand HABS/HAER documentation standards and how scanning addresses them
2. Evaluate scanning approaches for historic structures with complex geometry
3. Specify preservation-grade scanning deliverables
4. Balance documentation thoroughness with project budgets

### Email Body

Subject: Speaking opportunity for your members: Reality Capture for Renovation

Dear [Program Chair / Chapter Administrator],

I'm reaching out to propose a continuing education presentation for [Chapter Name] members.

**Topic:** Scan-to-BIM workflows for renovation and adaptive reuse projects

**Why This Matters for Architects:**
Renovation projects depend on accurate existing conditions documentation, yet most firms still rely on field measurements that introduce costly errors downstream. Laser scanning technology has matured significantly, but many architects aren't sure when it makes sense, how to specify it, or what to expect from the deliverables.

This session addresses those gaps with practical guidance architects can apply immediately.

**About Me:**
I'm Chase Pierson, COO of Scan2Plan, a reality capture firm based in the Hudson Valley specializing in renovation and historic preservation projects. We've worked with architects throughout the Northeast on projects ranging from 2,000 sqft residential renovations to 200,000 sqft institutional facilities.

**Session Options:**
1. "From Point Cloud to Construction Documents" — 60 min technical deep-dive with live demo
2. "The Business Case for Reality Capture" — 45 min ROI-focused presentation
3. "Documenting History" — 60 min historic preservation focus

All sessions are eligible for AIA continuing education credits (LU/HSW where applicable).

**What I'd Need:**
- Projector/screen for presentation
- 30 minutes for equipment setup if including live demo
- Attendee list for follow-up resources (optional)

I'm happy to tailor the content to your members' interests. If there's a particular angle that would resonate, I'm open to suggestions.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss? I'm available [suggest 2-3 dates/times] or can work around your schedule.

Thank you for considering this — I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your programming.

Best regards,

Chase Pierson
COO, Scan2Plan
[PHONE] | chase@scan2plan.dev

P.S. — I've attached a one-page overview of the proposed sessions and my speaking bio for your reference.

## Follow-Up Sequence

### If No Response: Day 7

**Subject:** Following up: AIA presentation proposal

Hi [Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my note last week about a potential presentation for [Chapter Name].

I'm flexible on timing and topic — happy to fit into whatever programming gaps you're looking to fill this quarter.

If presentations are booked for now, I'd also be interested in:
- Sponsoring a chapter event
- Providing a site visit/demo for members
- Contributing content to your newsletter

Let me know if any of those would be helpful.

Best,
Chase

### If No Response: Day 14

**Subject:** Last note: Reality capture presentation

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short — just wanted to send one more note before I close out my outreach.

If a presentation isn't the right fit right now, no worries at all. I'll plan to circle back later in the year.

In the meantime, if you ever have members asking about scanning services or wanting to learn more about the technology, feel free to point them my way. I'm always happy to answer questions, even outside of formal presentations.

Thanks for your time.

Chase

Appreciate the suggestion — I'd definitely consider sponsoring an event.

What sponsorship levels do you typically offer, and what does each include? I'm most interested in opportunities that include speaking time or member engagement (not just logo placement).
