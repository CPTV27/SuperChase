# [PROJECT NAME]
## Reality Capture & BIM Documentation Proposal

**Prepared for:**
[CLIENT CONTACT NAME]
[CLIENT COMPANY]
[CLIENT ADDRESS]

**Prepared by:**
[SENDER NAME]
Scan2Plan
Bearsville, NY
[PHONE] | [EMAIL]

**Date:** [DATE]
**Proposal Valid:** 30 days from date above

## Executive Summary

[CLIENT COMPANY] requires accurate as-built documentation for [PROJECT NAME], a [BRIEF PROJECT DESCRIPTION - e.g., "12,000 SF historic renovation in Kingston, NY"].

This proposal outlines Scan2Plan's approach to delivering engineering-grade reality capture and BIM documentation that meets your project's accuracy and timeline requirements.

**Key Deliverables:**
- [LIST PRIMARY DELIVERABLES]

**Investment:** $[TOTAL]
**Timeline:** [X] business days from site access

## Why Scan2Plan

### Engineering-Grade Accuracy

We deliver **±3mm registered accuracy**—verified and documented on every project.

This matters because:
- Design teams can trust dimensions without field verification
- MEP coordination happens in the model, not during construction
- Change orders from "unforeseen conditions" drop dramatically

### The Scan2Plan Difference

| | Marketing-Grade Scanning | Scan2Plan |
|---|---|---|
| **Typical Accuracy** | ±1-2% (industry standard) | ±3mm (measured & verified) |
| **Documentation** | Visual tours | Dimensional BIM models |
| **Use Case** | Real estate marketing, pre-lease tours | Design, construction, facility management |
| **QA Process** | Automated only | 12-Point Reliability Standard |
| **Deliverable** | Matterport tour, basic floor plans | Full Revit model, point cloud, CAD exports |

**Bottom line:** If you're designing to existing conditions, you need dimensions you can build from—not marketing visuals.

## The 12-Point Reliability Standard

Every Scan2Plan project passes our 12-Point Reliability Standard before delivery:

| # | Checkpoint | Specification |
|---|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Registration Accuracy | Mean error <3mm documented |
| 2 | Coordinate System | Aligned to project/site coordinates |
| 3 | Level Accuracy | Floor-to-floor heights verified |
| 4 | Wall Plumbness | Modeled walls match as-built conditions |
| 5 | Opening Dimensions | Doors/windows spot-checked against point cloud |
| 6 | Structural Alignment | Columns/beams verified to scan data |
| 7 | Model Organization | Worksets, phases, naming per standards |
| 8 | File Performance | Revit model tested for responsiveness |
| 9 | Point Cloud Linking | RCP links verified in model |
| 10 | Export Testing | DWG/IFC exports confirmed working |
| 11 | Deliverable Completeness | All requested outputs included |
| 12 | Documentation | Registration report + variance notes included |

**You receive:** A QA checklist confirming all 12 points passed, plus the registration report documenting actual accuracy achieved.
