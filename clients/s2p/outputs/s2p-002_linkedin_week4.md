## Post 1: Technical Deep-Dive
**Schedule:** Tuesday, Jan 28 @ 9:00 AM EST

### Content

**The 3mm question every architect should ask their scanning vendor:**

"What's your registered accuracy?"

Not marketing accuracy. Not manufacturer specs. *Registered* accuracy—the actual deviation after your scan data is processed and aligned.

Here's why it matters:

Most scanning vendors quote equipment specs (±2mm at 10m). But that's point-to-point accuracy in ideal conditions.

Real-world registered accuracy depends on:
→ Number of scan positions
→ Target placement strategy
→ Registration workflow (cloud-to-cloud vs. target-based)
→ QA verification method

We run a 12-point verification on every project. Our typical registered accuracy: ±3mm across the entire model.

That 3mm matters when you're:
• Designing MEP coordination in tight plenums
• Fitting millwork to existing conditions
• Documenting heritage details for preservation

**The question to ask:** "Can you show me your registration report?"

If they can't, you're designing on assumptions.

## Post 2: Project Showcase
**Schedule:** Thursday, Jan 30 @ 9:00 AM EST

### Content

**12,400 SF. 130 years old. Zero existing drawings.**

Last month we scanned a historic bank building in Kingston, NY for an adaptive reuse project.

The challenge: Convert an 1895 bank into mixed-use commercial space with no documentation to work from.

What we found hidden in the scan data:
• A structural beam that would have killed the architect's floor opening design
• 1.75" of floor slope nobody knew existed
• MEP routing that conflicted with the proposed ceiling plan

Total change orders prevented: $68,000

The architect's take: "We would have found that beam during demolition. That's a $24K change order minimum—probably more with the delay."

This is why we do what we do.

Engineering-grade accuracy isn't about bragging rights. It's about finding the problems *before* they find your budget.

## Post 3: Industry Insight
**Schedule:** Tuesday, Feb 4 @ 9:00 AM EST

### Content

**Renovation projects fail for one reason more than any other:**

Assumptions about existing conditions.

I've seen it repeatedly:
• "We thought that was a partition wall" — $40K structural fix
• "The drawings showed 9' ceilings" — $25K MEP redesign
• "Nobody mentioned the slope" — $15K floor leveling

Here's the math that keeps me up at night:

The average renovation change order is $12,000-$35,000.
The average project has 2-4 unforeseen condition issues.
That's $24K-$140K in risk on every renovation.

Meanwhile, engineering-grade reality capture costs 1-2% of construction budget.

Why do teams still rely on hand measurements and assumption?

Usually one of three reasons:
1. "We've always done it this way"
2. "The building isn't that complicated"
3. "We'll figure it out in the field"

All three are expensive lessons waiting to happen.

The firms winning renovation work right now? They're making scan data a line item on every project. Not because it's innovative—because it's insurance.

**Hot take: Matterport is not reality capture.**

It's real estate marketing that wandered into the AEC world.

Don't get me wrong—Matterport is fantastic for:
✓ Pre-lease virtual tours
✓ Property marketing
✓ Remote walkthroughs

But I've seen architects try to pull dimensions from Matterport models and end up with 2-3" variances. On a millwork install, that's a remake. On MEP coordination, that's a clash.

**The distinction matters:**

Marketing-grade (Matterport): ±1-2% accuracy, visual documentation
Engineering-grade (terrestrial scanning): ±3mm accuracy, dimensional documentation

One helps you sell buildings.
One helps you build them.

Both have their place. But if you're designing to existing conditions, you need to know which one you're working with.

**Question for the architects and contractors here:**

Have you ever had a project go sideways because the "scan data" wasn't accurate enough? What happened?

## Posting Notes

### Hashtag Strategy
- Primary: #RealityCapture #ScanToBIM #BIM #Architecture
- Secondary: #AEC #Construction #PointCloud
- Contextual: Vary by post topic (preservation, renovation, etc.)

### Engagement Protocol
- Respond to all comments within 4 hours during business hours
- Like/comment on commenter's recent posts to build reciprocity
- Save strong engagement threads for future content ideas

### Visual Assets Needed
- Post 1: Infographic showing registration accuracy concept (optional)
- Post 2: Point cloud screenshot from Kingston project (request from production team)
- Post 3: Text-only or simple stat graphic
- Post 4: Side-by-side Matterport vs terrestrial scan comparison (if available)

### Performance Tracking
- Track: impressions, engagement rate, profile visits, connection requests
- Goal: 3%+ engagement rate, 2+ inbound inquiries from content
