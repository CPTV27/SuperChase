- Firms without dedicated interiors team
- Architects who value design continuity
- Geographic focus: [LOCAL MARKET]

### Body

Subject: A potential collaboration — Tuthill Design

Dear [First Name],

I've been following [Firm Name]'s work for some time—[specific project or detail that caught your attention]. The [specific element: proportions / light quality / material restraint] speaks to a sensibility I deeply respect.

I'm reaching out because I run a residential interior design studio, and I'm always looking for architects whose vision aligns with how I approach space.

**Here's what I've noticed:**

Many architects I admire hand off interiors reluctantly—not because they don't care, but because there's rarely a design partner who honors the architectural intent. The result is often furniture that fights the building, or finishes that flatten what the architecture worked so hard to create.

I'd like to offer an alternative.

At Tuthill Design, we approach interiors as an extension of the architecture—not a departure from it. We work in close collaboration with architects to ensure material palettes, light quality, and spatial rhythm carry through from shell to finish.

**A few things that might be relevant:**
- We've partnered with [X] architects on residential projects
- Our process includes early coordination on finishes, millwork, and lighting
- We never compete for architectural scope—our work begins where yours completes

I'm not pitching a project. I'm simply introducing myself in case a collaboration ever makes sense.

If you're open to a brief conversation—coffee, a call, whatever works—I'd welcome the chance to learn more about how you work and share a bit about our approach.

Either way, thank you for the work you put into the world. It matters.

Warm regards,

- B: "Quick follow-up on interior design collaboration"

**Send:** Day 7 (if no response)

Subject: Following up — Tuthill Design

Dear [First Name],

I wanted to follow up briefly on my note last week about a potential collaboration between [Firm Name] and Tuthill Design.

I know how busy project cycles can be, so I'll keep this short:

If interior design partnerships are something you're open to exploring—whether now or for a future project—I'd welcome even 15 minutes to introduce our approach.

And if the timing isn't right, I completely understand. Feel free to keep my information on file, and don't hesitate to reach out if a project ever calls for it.

Either way, I appreciate your time—and your work.

Best,

P.S. — I've attached a brief overview of a recent collaboration with [Architect Name / Firm] on a residential project in [Location]. It might give you a sense of how we work alongside architects rather than apart from them.

## Targeting Criteria

### Ideal Architect Profile
- Residential focus (custom homes, high-end renovations)
- Firm size: 2-15 people (large enough to have projects, small enough to not have in-house interiors)
- Design-forward aesthetic (not production builders)
- Local or regional presence
- Active on design publications / awards / social media

### Where to Find Them
- AIA local chapter directories
- Architectural Digest regional features
- Houzz Pro profiles
- Instagram (design-focused accounts)
- Local design awards recipients

### Personalization Requirements
Each email must reference:
- Specific project they've completed
- Specific design element you admire
- Why their sensibility aligns with yours

**No generic sends.** This is relationship-building, not volume outreach.
