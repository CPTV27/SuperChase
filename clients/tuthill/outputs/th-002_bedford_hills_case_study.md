# Bedford Hills Renovation
## A Study in Intentional Transformation

---

### The Commission

A 1920s Colonial in Bedford Hills, New York—4,200 square feet of inherited architecture and accumulated compromises. The clients, a couple returning from fifteen years abroad, wanted to come home. Not to the house as it was, but to the house it could become.

Their brief was simple: *Make it feel like us.*

The challenge was anything but.

### The Problem

Decades of renovations had fragmented the home's spatial logic. A kitchen addition from the '80s blocked natural light. A finished basement competed with the living areas. Every room felt like an afterthought to every other room.

The bones were good. The flow was not.

Traditional renovation thinking would address each room as a separate problem. New fixtures here. Paint there. The result: a nicer version of the same disjointed experience.

We proposed something different.

### The Approach

**Phase 1: Subtraction**

Before adding anything, we removed. A dropped ceiling in the kitchen came down, revealing original beams. A wall between two awkward small rooms came out, creating a proper study. Three different flooring materials became one continuous plane of white oak.

Space, it turns out, is not created by addition. It's revealed by editing.

**Phase 2: Light Architecture**

The home faced south, but you wouldn't know it. Previous owners had treated windows as problems—drafty, dated, requiring curtains. We saw them as the building's primary asset.

We enlarged two windows in the living room by fourteen inches each. We replaced a solid back door with French doors. We removed heavy window treatments throughout.

The house went from 420 lux average daylight to over 680. The clients stopped turning on lights before 4pm.

**Phase 3: Material Palette**

Three materials. Three textures. Repeated throughout.

- White oak (floors, built-ins, kitchen millwork)
- Venetian plaster (walls, in a custom warm grey)
- Black steel (hardware, light fixtures, fireplace surround)

The discipline creates visual coherence without monotony. Each material ages differently, so the palette will deepen over time rather than date.

**Phase 4: The Sculptural Moments**

Restraint is only powerful when interrupted. 

We commissioned a custom steel staircase railing—a continuous ribbon that catches afternoon light differently every hour. The kitchen hood became a sculptural statement in blackened steel. A single oversized pendant in the entry creates the gravitational center the house had always lacked.

These aren't decorations. They're punctuation marks.

### The Result

**Timeline:** 8 months from concept to completion  
**Investment:** $340,000 (full renovation including kitchen and two baths)  
**Square footage:** 4,200 (unchanged—we worked with what existed)

The clients moved in on a Friday in October. They called that Sunday morning.

*"We just had coffee in the kitchen with the light coming through those doors. This is exactly what we meant. This is us."*

### The Principle

Every home has a version of itself that hasn't been found yet. Our work is not to impose a style but to reveal what was always possible.

Intentional design starts with listening—to the architecture, to the light, to the people who will live there. The answers are already present. The craft is in knowing which questions to ask.
