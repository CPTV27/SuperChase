# Documentary Pitch

## "Still Answering: 55 Years on the Line"

*A mini-documentary about Family of Woodstock and the enduring power of showing up*

---

## The Organization

**Family of Woodstock**
16 Rock City Road, Woodstock, NY 12498
familyofwoodstockinc.org

| Founded | 1970 |
|---------|------|
| **Origin** | Started as a "trip tent" at the Woodstock Festival |
| **Mission** | Crisis intervention, housing, food security, community support |
| **Services** | 24/7 hotline, emergency housing, food pantry, family services |
| **Annual Budget** | ~$4M |
| **Staff** | 80+ employees |
| **Reach** | Ulster County, NY (180,000 residents) |

**Why This Organization:**
Family of Woodstock is a living artifact of the counterculture's promise—that community could actually take care of its own. What started as volunteers helping people having bad trips at a music festival became the backbone of crisis response for an entire county. They've answered the phone for 55 years. That's the story.

---

## The Pitch

### Logline

When the music stopped at Woodstock, the helping didn't. *Still Answering* tells the story of a crisis hotline born at a rock festival that became the last safety net for a rural community—and the volunteers who've kept picking up the phone for 55 years.

### The Hook

Everyone knows Woodstock 1969. Almost no one knows what happened after.

While the crowd went home and the myth calcified, a small group of volunteers who'd spent the festival weekend talking people through bad trips asked a simple question: *What if we kept doing this?*

They set up a phone line. They answered it. They're still answering it.

### The Narrative Arc

**Act 1: The Beginning (1969-1975)**
- The festival and the trip tent
- The decision to continue
- Early days in a cramped office, all-volunteer
- The counterculture's promise: we take care of each other

**Act 2: The Institution (1975-2010)**
- Growth into full social services agency
- Tensions between hippie roots and professional demands
- The opioid crisis hits rural Ulster County
- Long-time volunteers age out; who replaces them?

**Act 3: The Present (2010-Now)**
- New generation of staff, same mission
- COVID and the mental health crisis
- The 24/7 hotline in the smartphone era
- What does "community" mean when no one answers their phone?

**Closing: The Call**
- We end where we began: someone picking up the phone
- The voice on the other end doesn't know the history
- They just know someone answered

## Visual Approach

### Aesthetic

**Look:** 16mm film texture, warm and grainy. Not nostalgic—*lived-in*.

**Inspiration:**
- *Won't You Be My Neighbor* (Morgan Neville) — institutional history through personal lens
- *The Social Dilemma* — intimate interviews, no talking heads
- *Crip Camp* — archival footage woven with present-day

### Key Visual Elements

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Archival footage** | 1969 festival footage, early Family photos, local news clips |
| **Hotline room** | Observational, low-light, long takes of volunteers on calls |
| **Woodstock landscape** | Catskills in all seasons, the physical place as character |
| **Interview setup** | Single subject, shallow depth of field, natural light |
| **B-roll** | Hands on phones, faces listening, the mundane ritual of care |

### Sound Design

- Layered phone conversations (anonymized, abstracted)
- Ambient room tone from the hotline office
- Period music (licensed sparingly, only when essential)
- Original score: solo piano, spare and patient

| **Current hotline volunteer** | Active, 5+ years | What it's like now, generational bridge |
| **Crisis caller** (anonymous/composite) | Recent client | The other end of the line |

### Secondary

| Subject | Role | Story Contribution |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Local historian** | Woodstock/Ulster County | Context for the community, counterculture legacy |

### Initial Outreach Email

**To:** Michael Berg, Executive Director
**Subject:** A film about Family of Woodstock's 55 years

Michael,

I've been thinking about Family of Woodstock for a while now—specifically, the fact that what started as a trip tent at a rock festival became the backbone of crisis response for an entire county. That's not just a nonprofit story. That's an American story.

I run a production studio that works with mission-driven organizations, and I'd love to explore making a short documentary about Family—not a promotional video, but a real film. Something that could screen at festivals, get seen beyond Ulster County, and give your 55 years the telling they deserve.

We do this work pro-bono for organizations whose stories matter. If you're open to a conversation, I'd love to buy you coffee and share what we're thinking.

No pressure either way. Just a filmmaker who thinks your story should exist as a film.

[Signature]
