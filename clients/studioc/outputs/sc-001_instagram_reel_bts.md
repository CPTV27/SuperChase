# Behind-the-Scenes Instagram Reel: Studio Session

## Concept

**Title:** "The Space Between Takes"
**Duration:** 60 seconds
**Feel:** Raw, authentic, documentary—like you walked into a session uninvited
**Music:** Lo-fi instrumental or ambient studio noise (no trending audio)

---

## Shot List & Script

### Opening (0:00-0:08)
**Visual:** Slow push into studio door. Handle turns. Door swings open to reveal darkened control room, Pro Tools interface glowing.

**Text on screen:** *"Some stories need a room to breathe."*

**Audio:** Door creak, room tone, faint click of session loading

---

### The Setup (0:08-0:18)
**Visual:** Hands adjusting mic position. Cable coiling. Headphones placed on stand. Close-up of faders. Light flickering on "recording" sign.

**Text on screen:** *[No text—let visuals speak]*

**Audio:** Ambient studio sounds. Soft hum of equipment. Chair adjusting.

---

### The Moment Before (0:18-0:28)
**Visual:** Host/guest settling into position. Deep breath. Eyes closed for a beat. Producer gives thumbs up through glass.

**Text on screen:** *"This is the moment before the story starts."*

**Audio:** Room tone. Single exhale. Silence.

---

### The Session (0:28-0:45)
**Visual:** Quick cuts—mouth close to mic, hands gesturing, genuine laugh, moment of vulnerability (eyes watering or looking away), producer nodding along, waveforms moving on screen.

**Text on screen:** *[No text—raw footage speaks]*

**Audio:** Actual session audio—fragments of conversation, laugh, emotional beat (ducked under music if using)

---

### The Craft (0:45-0:53)
**Visual:** Editor working in Pro Tools. Waveform being trimmed. EQ adjustments. Before/after audio visualization (if possible to show visually).

**Text on screen:** *"Every pause matters. Every breath is a choice."*

**Audio:** Click of mouse. Keyboard. Brief before/after audio snippet.

---

### Closing (0:53-1:00)
**Visual:** Wide shot of empty studio after session. Headphones on hook. Lights dimming. Door closing (reverse of opening).

**Text on screen:**
*"Studio C"*
*"Where stories find their voice."*

**Audio:** Fade to silence. Room tone.

## Caption

```
The story doesn't start when we hit record.

It starts in the breath before. The nervous hands. The moment someone decides to trust the room.

We don't make podcasts. We make space for voices that need to exist in the world.

This is what that looks like.

## Production Notes

### Filming Requirements
- **Camera:** iPhone Pro or mirrorless (Canon R6/Sony A7)
- **Lens:** 35mm or 50mm equivalent for intimate feel
- **Lighting:** Practical only—use existing studio lights, no added key light
- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 vertical for Reels
- **Frame Rate:** 24fps for cinematic feel (or 30fps for smoother motion)

### Footage Needed
| Shot | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Studio door opening | Film new | Slow, deliberate push |
| Mic/cable/gear details | Film new | Macro or close-up, shallow DOF |
| Session footage | Pull from recent session | Get client permission |
| Producer through glass | Film new | Soft focus on glass reflection |
| Pro Tools editing | Screen record + over-shoulder | Show actual waveforms |
| Empty studio closing | Film new | Mirror opening shot |

### Audio Requirements
- Capture clean room tone (30 seconds minimum)
- Session audio clips need client approval
- Consider original lo-fi track or license-free ambient

### Editing Style
- Cuts on beat or breath, not fast/trendy
- Color grade: Desaturated, warm shadows, lifted blacks
- No flashy transitions—cuts and fades only
- Text: Simple sans-serif (Space Grotesk), subtle fade in/out

## Posting Strategy

**Best Time:** Sunday 11:00 AM (per content calendar) or Thursday 11:00 AM
**Stories:** Share to stories with "New Reel" sticker + poll: "What story would you trust us with?"
**Cross-post:** Share to LinkedIn with professional caption variant

### LinkedIn Caption Variant
```
There's a moment in every podcast session—right before we hit record—where the room holds its breath.

That's the moment we built Studio C for.

Not for polished soundbites. For the raw, human stories that need space to unfold.

This 60-second glimpse is what our process actually looks like. No staging. No scripts. Just craft.

If you're sitting on a story that needs to be told, let's talk.
