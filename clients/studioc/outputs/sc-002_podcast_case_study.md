# Case Study: The Restoration Project Podcast

## From Kitchen Table Recording to 10,000 Downloads

*How a nonprofit founder turned her story into a movement—with the right room and the right team behind her.*

---

## The Story Before the Story

Maya Chen had been running The Restoration Project for six years. A Nashville-based nonprofit helping formerly incarcerated women rebuild their lives through job training and mentorship.

She had stories. Hundreds of them. Women who'd gone from prison cells to corner offices. From addiction to advocacy. From invisible to undeniable.

"I knew these stories needed to be heard," Maya told us. "But every time I tried to record something, it felt... wrong. Flat. Like the weight of what these women had survived wasn't coming through."

She'd been recording on her laptop in her kitchen. The audio was technically "fine." But fine doesn't change minds. Fine doesn't raise money. Fine doesn't build movements.

Maya needed more than a microphone upgrade. She needed a partner who understood that some stories require a room built to hold them.

## The Challenge

When Maya came to Studio C, she had:

- **12 recorded episodes** on her laptop (unusable quality)
- **Zero technical knowledge** of audio production
- **A shoestring budget** (nonprofit reality)
- **Unlimited powerful stories** waiting to be told

Her goals were clear:
1. Launch a podcast that sounded professional enough to attract donors
2. Create a sustainable production workflow she could maintain
3. Amplify the voices of the women in her program—not overshadow them

The unspoken challenge: Maya was terrified of the technology. Every "podcast course" she'd taken made her feel more overwhelmed, not less.

## The Transformation

### Phase 1: Finding Her Voice (Week 1-2)

We didn't start with equipment. We started with listening.

Maya came into the studio with three of her program graduates. We recorded a two-hour conversation—no agenda, no script, no pressure. Just four women talking about survival, redemption, and hope.

That session gave us everything we needed:
- Maya's natural interviewing rhythm (she listens like a therapist)
- The emotional beats that made the stories land
- The technical requirements for capturing intimate conversation

**Key insight:** Maya didn't need to become a "podcast host." She needed to stay exactly who she was—a bridge between these women and the world.

### Phase 2: Building the Sound (Week 3-4)

We developed a sonic identity for The Restoration Project:

| Element | Decision | Reason |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Intro/Outro** | Piano + ambient room tone | Warm, not corporate |
| **Interview style** | Two-mic intimate setup | Conversation, not interrogation |
| **Music beds** | Minimal, only under transitions | Stories need silence to breathe |
| **Episode length** | 25-35 minutes | Respect listener's time |

We recorded the first three episodes in our studio, then trained Maya on a portable setup she could use in the field—because some stories need to be recorded where they happened.

### Phase 3: Launch & Handoff (Week 5-6)

We launched with:
- 3 episodes ready to publish
- Cover art and social assets
- Distribution to all major platforms
- A simple production workflow Maya could handle solo

But more importantly: Maya left with confidence. She'd seen behind the curtain. The technology wasn't magic—it was just tools in service of story.

## In Maya's Words

> "I spent two years feeling like a fraud. Recording episode after episode that I knew I'd never publish. Every YouTube tutorial made me feel more behind.
>
> Studio C didn't teach me to be a podcaster. They showed me I already was one—I just needed the right room and someone who understood what I was trying to do.
>
> The first time I heard the final mix of Episode 1, I cried. Not because it sounded 'professional.' Because it finally sounded *true*. Like the weight of these women's stories was actually there.
>
> That's what I couldn't do alone. And that's what changed everything."
>

## The Ongoing Partnership

Today, The Restoration Project is in its second season. Maya records interviews on-site at her program locations using the portable kit we built for her. She sends us the raw files, we handle post-production, and episodes go live within a week.

The podcast has become her primary donor cultivation tool. "When someone asks what we do, I don't hand them a brochure anymore. I tell them to listen to Episode 7. Then they call me back ready to write a check."

We've also helped her:
- Repurpose podcast audio into 30-second social clips
- Create a "best of" highlight reel for grant applications
- Train two program graduates as production assistants

## What Made the Difference

When we asked Maya what she'd tell someone considering working with us, she paused.

"Don't go to Studio C if you want to sound like every other podcast. Go if you have something real to say and you need people who understand that the story is more important than the tech.

They're not producers. They're... archivists. They hold space for stories that matter."

## Ready to Tell Your Story?

If you're sitting on stories that need to be heard—but the technical barrier feels insurmountable—let's talk.

We work with mission-driven organizations, founders, and advocates who have something real to say. No experience required. Just a willingness to trust the process.
