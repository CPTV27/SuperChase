## Email Template

**Subject:** Quick question about [Org Name]'s stories

Hi [First Name],

I've been following [Org Name]'s work on [specific program/campaign], and I keep thinking: these stories need to be heard—not just read.

I run a podcast production studio in Nashville that works exclusively with mission-driven organizations. We've helped nonprofits turn their client stories into podcasts that actually move donors and change minds.

Not pitching anything here—just curious if audio is something you've ever considered? I'd love to share what we've learned about what works (and what doesn't) for orgs like yours.

Either way, keep doing what you're doing. It matters.

[Signature]
