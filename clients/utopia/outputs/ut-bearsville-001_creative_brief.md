## 🎨 VISUAL APPROACH

**Reference Films:**
- *Sound City* (Dave Grohl) — for studio-as-character approach
- *Muscle Shoals* — for sense of place and mythology
- *The Wrecking Crew* — for archival integration

**Aesthetic:**
- Cinematic, reverent, warm
- The studio as sacred space
- Natural light through windows
- Intimate interview setups (not talking-head sterile)
- Archival treated with care (not Ken Burns overuse)

**Studio C Production Stack:**
- Capture at Utopia with full production capability
- Remote direction for off-site interviews
- Same-day rough assembly for review
- AI-assisted transcription and pull-quote identification

---

## 🎵 MUSIC STRATEGY

**Clearances Needed:**
- Clips from recordings made at Bearsville (masters)
- Performance footage if available
- Original score for connective tissue

**Sam Erickson's Role:**
- Music supervision
- Label relationships for clearances
- Artist access through industry network

**Approach:**
- Use actual Bearsville recordings as score where possible
- Original compositions for transitions/mood
- Avoid needle-drops that feel disconnected from the space

## 🎬 WHY THIS MATTERS

Bearsville isn't just a documentary about a recording studio. It's about:

- **Sanctuary** — Artists need places away from the industry to create
- **Legacy** — What happens when the founders die and new stewards take over
- **Magic** — Some places just have it, and we don't fully understand why
- **Persistence** — Pete's fight to keep this alive when easier paths exist

The audience:
- Music fans who love the artists who recorded here
- Gear heads and producers who worship the sound
- Documentary audiences who love behind-the-scenes access
- Woodstock/Hudson Valley community with local pride

This is *Sound City* for the East Coast. The untold story of rock's hidden cathedral.
