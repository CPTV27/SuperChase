## 📋 LOGLINE

---

## 🎯 THESIS STATEMENT

Bearsville Studios wasn't just a recording facility — it was a philosophy. Albert Grossman built a creative sanctuary where artists could escape the industry machine and make music on their own terms. This documentary argues that the spirit of Bearsville — artist autonomy, sonic experimentation, and creative community — is more relevant than ever, and that Pete Kagan's Utopia is carrying that torch forward.
