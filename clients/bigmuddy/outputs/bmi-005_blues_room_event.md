## Event Description

```
Live blues in the room where the river used to sing.

Amy Allen takes the stage in our intimate 50-seat Blues Room — a speakeasy-style venue tucked inside Big Muddy Inn. Silk-draped walls, candlelit tables, and the kind of music that makes you forget what year it is.

Amy's voice carries the weight of the Delta, the hope of the river, and the stories of everyone who's ever sat on a barstool in Natchez Under-the-Hill.

50 seats. One night. The blues the way they're meant to be heard.

🎟️ Tickets: [LINK]
🛏️ Stay the night: thebigmuddyinn.com

Make a weekend of it — book a room and wake up to Mississippi River fog the morning after the music.
