## EMAIL 1: THE STORY
### "Welcome to Big Muddy Inn"

**Subject Lines (Test 2-3):**
- "The story of Silver Street (and why we ended up here)"

- "Welcome — and a secret about Natchez"

**From:** Amy & Tracy <hello@bigmuddyinn.com>

**Body:**

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

I'm Amy. I used to just sing the blues — now I live them.

When Tracy and I found this building at the foot of Silver Street, we weren't looking for a business. We were looking for a feeling. The Mississippi rolls past our door. The ghosts of riverboat gamblers and blues legends still walk these streets.

So we opened Big Muddy Inn.

Every suite is named for someone who shaped this sound — Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Etta James. Every night, the Blues Room fills with music. No cover. No pretension. Just the sound that started right here in the Delta.

We're not a hotel. We're a story you get to sleep inside.

I'd love to tell you more — but I think you'd rather experience it yourself.

Hit reply if you have questions. I read everything.

See you on Silver Street,

**Amy**
*Singer, Storyteller, Innkeeper*

11 Silver Street, Natchez, MS

P.S. — We have live blues in the room below every [DAYS]. Just saying.

**Body:**

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Planning a visit? Let me save you hours of research.

Here's exactly what Tracy and I would do if we had 48 hours in Natchez (and we actually do this with friends who visit):

**FRIDAY**

🌅 **5:00 PM** — Check in at Big Muddy. We'll welcome you personally.

🍸 **6:30 PM** — Walk up to King's Tavern for a cocktail. It's the oldest building in the Mississippi Territory. Ask about the skeleton they found in the wall.

🎵 **8:30 PM** — Back to our Blues Room. Grab a seat, grab a drink, let the music wash over you.

**SATURDAY**

☕ **8:00 AM** — Coffee on Silver Street. Watch the river wake up.

🏛 **10:00 AM** — Antebellum house tour (Longwood is the one with the unfinished dome — haunting).

🍽 **12:30 PM** — Lunch at [LOCAL RECOMMENDATION]. Tell them we sent you.

🚶 **3:00 PM** — Walk the bluffs. The views are ridiculous.

🪦 **5:30 PM** — Natchez City Cemetery at twilight. I'll tell you which graves to visit.

🎶 **8:00 PM** — Blues Room again. Different band, same magic.

**SUNDAY**

🌊 **7:00 AM** — Sunrise on the river (trust me)

🥐 **9:00 AM** — Slow breakfast, no rush

👋 **11:00 AM** — Check out. Plan your return trip.

That's the weekend. No tourist traps. No wasted time.

Reply with your dates and I'll tell you what's happening that weekend.

**Amy**

P.S. — Scroll down for a little thank-you for reading this far...
