### Body

Hi [First Name],

We're Amy and Tracy, and we'd love to tell you how we ended up running a six-room inn on the banks of the Mississippi River.

It started with a song.

Amy was performing at a juke joint in Natchez Under-the-Hill—the old riverfront district where steamboats used to dock and blues musicians played for anyone who'd listen. Tracy was in the audience. The river was doing that thing it does at sunset, turning gold and slow.

We looked at each other and thought: *What if we never left?*

So we didn't.

We found a building. We filled it with art, stories, and a 50-seat music room we call the Blues Room. We opened the doors and started welcoming travelers who wanted more than a bed—they wanted a front-row seat to the river.

That's Big Muddy Inn.

Six rooms. One stage. Endless stories.

If you've ever wanted to wake up to Mississippi fog, hear live blues in an intimate room, or simply sit on a porch and watch the world's most storied river roll by—we'd love to host you.

Come stay with us.

Still thinking about that Mississippi River getaway? Let us paint you a picture.

---

**FRIDAY**

**5:00 PM** — Check in. We'll show you to your room, pour you a glass of wine, and point you toward the porch. The river's doing its golden-hour thing.

**7:00 PM** — Dinner at King's Tavern, the oldest building in the Natchez Territory (and yes, it's haunted—ask us about Madeline). Three-minute walk from your door.

**9:00 PM** — Blues Room opens. Tonight: live music in our intimate 50-seat venue. Amy might be on stage. Pull up a chair.

---

**SATURDAY**

**7:00 AM** — Wake up to river fog. Coffee's ready on the porch. No agenda. Just the water.

**10:00 AM** — Walking tour of Under-the-Hill. Cobblestones, storefronts, and stories from when this was the wildest street on the river.

**12:00 PM** — Lunch at Magnolia Grill. Catfish. Sweet tea. A ceiling fan turning slow.

**3:00 PM** — Ghost tour of Natchez (if you dare). Or: nap on the porch. We won't judge.

**7:00 PM** — Dinner downtown. We'll give you our list.

**9:00 PM** — Back to the Blues Room. Different band. Same magic.

---

**SUNDAY**

**9:00 AM** — Sleep in. The river will wait.

**11:00 AM** — Brunch at Fat Mama's Tamales. Get the Knock-You-Naked Margarita. Trust us.
