## Template 1: King's Tavern Cross-Promo

**To:** Owner/Manager, King's Tavern
**Subject:** Partnership idea — Big Muddy + King's Tavern

---

Hi [Name],

I'm Amy Allen — my wife Tracy and I own Big Muddy Inn, just down the street on Commerce.

I have an idea that could put guests in both our doors.

**The concept: "Stay at the River, Dine with the Ghosts"**

Here's what I'm thinking:
- We recommend King's Tavern to every guest who asks where to eat (which is all of them)
- You mention Big Muddy when visitors ask where to stay in Under-the-Hill
- We create a simple "package" we can both promote: stay + dinner, one easy booking

No money changes hands. No complicated tracking. Just two businesses a few blocks apart sending people to each other.

We've got 6 rooms, you've got the best food and ghost stories in Natchez. Seems like a natural fit.

Would you be up for grabbing a drink this week to talk it through? I'll come to you — and I promise not to ask Madeline any questions.

**Follow-up (Day 5 if no response):**

Subject: Quick follow-up — Big Muddy partnership

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up — the cross-promo idea for Big Muddy + King's Tavern.

No pressure at all. If the timing's not right, I completely understand. But if you're interested, I'd love 15 minutes to sketch it out over coffee (or something stronger).

Either way, keep doing what you're doing. That building is magic.

— Amy

## Template 2: Local Shop Portrait Exchange

**To:** Owner, [Local Shop Name]
**Subject:** Free portrait for your shop — quick idea

---

Hi [Name],

I'm Amy Allen from Big Muddy Inn. I walk past [Shop Name] almost every day and always love what you've got in the window.

Here's a random idea:

We're doing a photo shoot soon to capture the best of Natchez Under-the-Hill. I'd love to include your shop — exterior shot, maybe a portrait of you in your space.

**What you get:** Professional photo of your shop, free to use however you want.

**What we get:** Permission to feature [Shop Name] in our "Natchez Guide" content and maybe display one of your pieces in our inn (with credit, of course).

No cost, no commitment, no weird strings. Just two local businesses helping each other look good.

Interested? I can stop by this week to chat.

## Template 3: Blues Trail Package Listing

**To:** Mississippi Blues Trail / Visit Natchez Tourism Contact
**Subject:** Big Muddy Inn — Blues Trail lodging partner?

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out about listing Big Muddy Inn as a lodging partner on the Mississippi Blues Trail resources.

**About us:**
- 6-room boutique inn in Natchez Under-the-Hill
- On-site 50-seat live music venue (the Blues Room)
- Weekly performances by regional blues artists
- I'm a blues singer myself — the inn is built around the music

**Why it fits the Trail:**
Guests traveling the Blues Trail need places to stay that *feel* like the blues. Not chain hotels. Not generic B&Bs. They want to sleep where the music lives.

That's what we built.

**What we're asking:**
- Inclusion in "Where to Stay" resources for Natchez
- Potential package: "Blues Trail Weekend" (stay + Blues Room show + Trail map)
- Cross-promotion on social media

We're happy to provide photos, copy, whatever you need. And if there's a fee for listing, just let me know.

Would love to connect and explore how we can support Blues Trail travelers together.

## Template 4: Festival Organizer Partnership

**To:** Festival Director / Event Coordinator
**Subject:** Lodging partner for [Festival Name]?

---

Hi [Name],

I'm Amy Allen, owner of Big Muddy Inn in Natchez Under-the-Hill.

With [Festival Name] coming up, I wanted to reach out about a potential partnership.

**What we offer:**
- 6 boutique rooms, 3 blocks from [venue/downtown]
- Block rates for festival attendees or performers
- On-site venue (Blues Room) for afterparties or intimate sets
- Local hosts who can guide visitors to the best of Natchez

**What we're looking for:**
- "Official lodging partner" or recommended stay listing
- Inclusion in festival communications to attendees
- Cross-promotion opportunity (we'll promote the festival to our guests)

We hosted [X guests / performers] for [previous event] and the feedback was incredible. Happy to share testimonials.

Would you have 15 minutes to chat about how we could work together for this year's festival?
