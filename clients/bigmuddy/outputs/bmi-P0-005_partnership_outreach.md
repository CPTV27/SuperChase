## TEMPLATE 1: KING'S TAVERN
### Venue Partnership — Weekend Music + Guest Referrals

**Subject:** A Natchez partnership idea (Big Muddy Inn)

---

Hi [NAME],

I'm Amy from Big Muddy Inn — we're just down Silver Street from you.

I've been sending guests your way for months (the skeleton story alone is worth the walk). But I wanted to see if we could make this more intentional.

**Here's what I'm thinking:**

**We send you:**
- Our guests, primed with a personal recommendation
- A feature in our "48-Hour Natchez Itinerary" (we share this with every booking)
- A mention in our Instagram posts when we shoot content on Silver Street

**You send us:**
- A mention to visitors who need overnight accommodation
- Maybe a table tent or card at the bar?
- A tag when you post about Under-the-Hill

**Bonus idea:** We could do a "Dinner + Blues" package — guests book dinner at King's Tavern, then walk back to us for live music in the Blues Room. We split the promo.

No contracts, no nonsense. Just neighbors helping neighbors.

Want to grab a coffee (or something stronger) and talk through it?

P.S. — I'd love to hear the real story about that skeleton sometime.

## TEMPLATE 2: LOCAL SHOPS
### Portrait Exchange — Cross-Post Amplification

**Subject:** Free professional portrait of your shop (+ a partnership idea)

---

Hi [NAME],

I'm Amy from Big Muddy Inn. I walk past [SHOP NAME] almost every day — your [SPECIFIC THING YOU NOTICED] always catches my eye.

We're shooting a content series about the people who make Natchez special. Not the tourist-brochure version — the real version.

**Here's my offer:**

I'll send our photographer to capture:
- A professional portrait of you at work
- A few detail shots of your space
- A quick 2-minute interview about why you love Natchez

**What you get:**
- The photos (yours to use however you want)
- A feature in our "Meet the Makers of Natchez" blog series
- Tags and mentions when we post

**What we'd love:**
- You share the post when it goes live (tag us)
- You mention Big Muddy Inn if guests ask about lodging
- Maybe a card on your counter? (We'll provide them)

No cost, no catch. Just building a network of Natchez originals.

Interested? Reply with a good day/time for a 20-minute shoot.

## TEMPLATE 3: BLUES TRAIL / TOURISM ORGANIZATIONS
### Destination Partnership — Package Promotion

**Subject:** Natchez Stay + Blues Trail package idea

---

Hi [NAME],

I'm Amy Allen — singer and co-owner of Big Muddy Inn in Natchez.

We're the only boutique inn on the Blues Trail with a live music venue on-site (the Blues Room — no cover, authentic Delta blues).

I'd love to explore a partnership:

**Package Concept: "Stay on the Trail"**
- 2-night stay at Big Muddy Inn
- Live blues both nights
- Blues Trail map + curated driving route
- Exclusive pricing for visitors coming through your channels

**What we offer:**
- Featured accommodation for your website/materials
- Commission or referral fee on bookings
- Content (photos, video) you can use

**What we'd love:**
- Listing as recommended lodging on the Blues Trail
- Inclusion in any Natchez/Delta marketing
- Introduction to festival organizers

We're building something special here. I think it fits perfectly with what you're doing.

Worth a conversation?

Hi [NAME],

P.S. — If any artists need a place to stay, we'd love to host them. The Blues Room might even convince them to play an impromptu set...

## TEMPLATE 5: ARDENT STUDIOS / STUDIO C
### Cross-Regional — Memphis to Natchez Corridor

**Subject:** Memphis → Natchez: Music tourism corridor?

---

Hi [NAME],

I'm Amy Allen — singer and co-owner of Big Muddy Inn in Natchez.

I've been thinking about the natural corridor between Memphis and Natchez for music tourism. Ardent → Blues Trail → Big Muddy.

**Rough Idea:**
- Artists record at Ardent / Studio C
- While in the region, they play a set at our Blues Room
- We document it (video content for both of us)
- Fans can book the "Memphis to Natchez" music trip

No pressure, just wanted to plant the seed. If you ever have artists looking for a unique show opportunity south of Memphis, we've got a stage and an audience.

Open to a call?

Hi [NAME],
