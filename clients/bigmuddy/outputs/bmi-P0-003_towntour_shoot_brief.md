# BIG MUDDY INN — TOWN TOUR SHOOT BRIEF
## 1-Day Production Plan

---

## 🎯 CONCEPT

**Title:** "Stay With Storytellers"
**Hosts:** Amy Allen & Tracy
**Premise:** Amy and Tracy guide viewers through their Natchez — the spots only locals know, the stories that don't make the brochures.

**Tone:** Warm, authentic, unhurried. Southern hospitality without the kitsch. A little mysterious (ghost tour energy), a little musical (Amy's blues connection).
