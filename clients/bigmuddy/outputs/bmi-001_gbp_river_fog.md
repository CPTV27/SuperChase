### Caption

```
There's a moment every morning—right before the sun burns through—when the Mississippi disappears into fog.

The river's still there. You can hear it. But all you see is white, and for a few minutes, it feels like the whole world is just this porch, this coffee, this quiet.

Then the fog lifts, and the river comes back. Gold light on the water. A barge sliding past. The day beginning the way it's begun here for 300 years.

This is why we live on the river. This is why we built Big Muddy.
