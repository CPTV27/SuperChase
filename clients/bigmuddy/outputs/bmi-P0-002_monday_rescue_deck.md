# SLIDE 1: SITUATION

## Where We Are

**The Good:**
- Stunning Southern Gothic aesthetic
- Unique location (Under-the-Hill, river views)
- Blues Room = differentiator no competitor has
- Strong story (Amy as singer, local curator angle)

**The Problem:**
- Cash flow is bleeding
- OTA listings not optimized
- No consistent content or booking funnel
- Local partnerships untapped

**The Opportunity:**
- Natchez tourism is growing
- Blues/heritage tourism is a real market
- Spring Pilgrimage season approaching
- You have assets — they just need deployment

- Cemetery at twilight (ghost tour tease)
- River sunrise/sunset
- Local shopkeepers (portraits for cross-posting)

**Deliverables:**

| 10 hero photos | OTAs, website, social |
| 15s promo | Instagram Reels |
| 30s promo | Facebook, YouTube |
| 60s promo | Website hero |
| 5 blog posts | SEO, email content |

**Production Time:** 1 day shoot + 3 days post

| RevPAR | $30 | $61 | $100 |
