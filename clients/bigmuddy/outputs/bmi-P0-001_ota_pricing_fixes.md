# OTA Pricing Quick Fixes Sheet

## Big Muddy Inn & Blues Room — Immediate Revenue Optimization

*1-page action sheet for Tracy & Amy — implement today*

---

## PART 1: Listing Titles (Update Now)

### Current Problem
Generic titles don't differentiate from chain hotels. OTA algorithms favor specific, keyword-rich titles.

### Optimized Titles (Copy/Paste Ready)

**Booking.com / Expedia:**
```
Big Muddy Inn — Boutique Riverfront Stay in Historic Natchez Under-the-Hill
```

**Airbnb:**
```
Historic Natchez River Inn ★ Live Blues Venue ★ Walk to Dining & River
```

**VRBO:**
```
Boutique Inn on Mississippi River — Blues Room, River Views, Historic Natchez
```

**Google Business Profile:**
```
Big Muddy Inn & Blues Room | Boutique Hotel Natchez Under-the-Hill
```

| Sun-Thu | 1.0x | $159 |
| Friday | 1.25x | $199 |
