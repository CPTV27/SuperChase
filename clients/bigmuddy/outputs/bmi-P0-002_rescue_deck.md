# Monday Rescue Deck

## Big Muddy Inn & Blues Room — 90-Day Turnaround Plan

*6-slide deck for owners Amy & Tracy*

---

# SLIDE 1: Situation + Immediate Recommendation

## The Situation

**Where We Are:**
- Cash bleeding faster than bookings coming in
- OTA listings underperforming (pricing, photos, copy not optimized)
- Blues Room events not driving room bookings
- No systematic marketing driving direct bookings
- Limited local partnerships generating referrals

**The Core Problem:**
Big Muddy has a *product* people love (reviews prove it).
Big Muddy does not have a *system* that fills rooms consistently.

---

## Immediate Recommendation

**Focus everything on one goal:**

### Break-Even in 90 Days

Not "growth." Not "brand building." **Survival.**

Every action we take in the next 90 days must answer:
> "Does this put a guest in a room this month?"

If yes → do it.
If no → table it.
