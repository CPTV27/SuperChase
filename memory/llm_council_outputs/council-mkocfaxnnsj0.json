  "query": "You are analyzing Scan2Plan, a reality capture and 3D scanning services company targeting AEC professionals (architects, engineers, contractors).\n\nCURRENT STATE:\n- Q1 Revenue Goal: $100K (currently at $45K = 45% complete)\n- Q1 Deadline: March 31, 2026\n- Content Authority: 150 engagements (target: 1,000 = 15% complete)\n- Active Strategies: Case Study Lead Magnets, Technical Deep-Dive Series\n- Industry: Construction Tech / AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction)\n- Stage: Growth\n\nKEY QUESTIONS FOR THE COUNCIL:\n\n1. PRICING & PACKAGING: Using Alex Hormozi's \"$100M Offers\" framework, what is the highest-leverage way to restructure Scan2Plan's service offering to increase average deal size? Current packages are project-based quotes.\n\n2. PIPELINE ACCELERATION: With $55K gap to close in ~10 weeks, what specific sales acceleration tactics would generate the fastest pipeline movement? Consider: existing quote follow-ups, referral triggers, urgency mechanisms.\n\n3. CONTENT LEVERAGE: The \"Technical Deep-Dive Series\" has low traction (150 engagements). Should this be pivoted, doubled-down, or paired with a different distribution channel? What would move the needle fastest for lead generation?\n\n4. COMPETITIVE MOAT: What defensible positioning should Scan2Plan establish to avoid commoditization as 3D scanning technology becomes more accessible?\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations with estimated impact (High/Medium/Low) and effort (High/Medium/Low). No generic advice - reference the specific numbers and context provided.",
