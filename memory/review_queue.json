    "content": "When it comes to renovation projects, the level of detail in your BIM model can mean the difference between a smooth construction phase and costly change orders...\n\nLOD 350 provides the precision needed for MEP coordination, clash detection, and accurate quantity takeoffs. Our recent project at The Castle demonstrated how ±3mm variance control prevented $280K in potential conflicts.\n\n## Key Benefits\n- Precise MEP routing\n- Accurate clash detection\n- Reliable quantity takeoffs\n- Reduced RFIs during construction",

Parallel processing pipelines and automated QC checks that catch issues before they become expensive problems.\n\n3/ Result: 3-5 week delivery instead of 8-12 weeks. Your design team isn't waiting on data.\n\n4/ DM for our processing workflow whitepaper.",
